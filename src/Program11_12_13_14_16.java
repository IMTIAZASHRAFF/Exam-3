/*	Question 11-Write a Difference between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer?
 *  Ans:The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes 
 *  are mutable. StringBuilder is non synchronized(not thread safe), but the Stringbuffer is synchronized(Thread safe).
 *  
 *  Question 12-What is the difference between List and set?
 *  Ans:List is a type of ordered collection that maintains the elements in insertion order,
 *       while Set is a type of unordered collection so elements are not maintained any order.
 *       
 *  Question 13-What is the difference between Array & ArrayList?
 *  Ans:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. 
 *      We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.
 *      
 *  Question 14-What is the difference between HAshset and Treeset?
 *  Ans:A Set is a generic set of values with no duplicate elements. A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted.
        A HashSet is a set where the elements are not sorted or ordered. It is faster than a TreeSet. 
        The HashSet is an implementation of a Set.
 *       
 *   Question 16-What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator? Explain using short java programs. 
 *               Also list advantages and disadvantages of both.
 *        Ans:Comparable and Comparator both are interfaces and can be used to sort collection elements.
 *        Comparable provides a single sorting sequence, but The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences.
 *        Comparable affects the original class, but Comparator doesn't affect the original class
